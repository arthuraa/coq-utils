This is a basic set of libraries for Coq based on Ssreflect.
It requires:

- Coq v8.6
- Some MathComp packages, version 1.6 (https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp). In OPAM, just look for:
  * coq-mathcomp-ssreflect
  * coq-mathcomp-fingroup
  * coq-mathcomp-algebra

To compile:

coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
make

To install:

make install
